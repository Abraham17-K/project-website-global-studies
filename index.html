                                        1989, when the Tiananmen Square Massacre happened. He saw the soldiers in the
                                        square, and went up to them, standing in front of them and making the stop sign.
                                        He was seen speaking to the crew of one of the tanks momentarily, but the
                                        government quickly shut off the news broadcast and the fate of Tank Man is
                                        unknown. However, given the high death toll at the massacre, it is likely that
                                        he was killed or imprisoned.</p>

                                        of which were students, packed themselves into Tiananmen Square in Beijing,
                                        China.
                                        They demanded political freedom in China. After the government refused to
                                        listen, their protest soon became a hunger strike. Days later, the government
                                        was still refusing to meet with the protestors, so ordinary men and women from
                                        Beijing began to bring them food to support their movement. After unsuccessful
                                        talks with government officials, 200,000 soldiers converged on the square.
                                        Nobody knows what happened next, as news broadcasts cut out and the Chinese
                                        government denies that the protests ever happened.</p>
