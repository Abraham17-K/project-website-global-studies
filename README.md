To view the website, download the Full-Code.zip file from "releases" on the right. Open the .zip archive, then open the index.html file. It should open a copy of the website in your defauly browser.

Even though the site will be offline, you MUST be connected to the internet for it to load properly as I am loading a library from online.


If you would like to read the code, you should be able to read the other files in this directory like text files. The .html file is
for the structure of the site, the .css is for styling components, and the .js file is for javascript code used for some additional
styles.
